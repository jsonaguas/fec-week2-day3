2. Building Responsive Layouts with CSS Grid

Objective: The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with the CSS Grid layout system and its application in creating responsive web designs. By the end of this assignment, students should be able to utilize CSS Grid properties to construct and adapt web page layouts for different screen sizes.

Problem Statement: Creating web layouts that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional across a variety of devices is a key challenge in modern web design. CSS Grid offers a powerful and flexible approach to designing web page layouts that can dynamically adjust to screen size, enhancing the user experience. This assignment challenges you to apply CSS Grid techniques to design a responsive web layout that gracefully transitions across different viewing devices.



Task 1: Create a Basic CSS Grid Layout Start by designing a simple web page layout using CSS Grid. Your layout should include a header, a main content area divided into two columns (for content and sidebar), and a footer. Define the grid container and set up the grid template areas.

Expected Outcome: A web page with a CSS Grid-based layout, featuring a header, a two-column main content area, and a footer.



Task 2: Implement Responsive Design Using CSS Grid Modify your CSS Grid layout to be responsive. Use media queries to change the layout for smaller screens by stacking the content and sidebar vertically instead of horizontally.

Expected Outcome: The layout changes to a single-column format on screens narrower than 768 pixels, stacking the header, content, sidebar, and footer vertically.



Task 3: Advanced Grid Layout with Template Columns and Rows Enhance your grid layout by specifying the size of columns and rows using the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties. Experiment with fractional units (fr) and fixed sizes (e.g., pixels) to create a balanced layout.

Expected Outcome: A more refined layout where the main content area is larger than the sidebar on wider screens, with responsive adjustments for smaller devices.
